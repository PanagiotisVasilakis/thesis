# CI-CD Reports

This directory stores artifacts generated by the continuous integration pipeline.

## Vulture Reports

`unused-code.yml` runs [Vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture) to detect
unused Python code. Known dynamic entry points can be listed in the `.vulture-ignore`
file at the repository root. The workflow passes these patterns to Vulture so they
are excluded from the report.

After a workflow run, the Vulture output is saved under `CI-CD_reports/` with a
name like `vulture_report_<run_number>.txt`. You can also download the artifact
from the GitHub Actions run.

To review a report locally with the same exclusions, run:

```bash
vulture --min-confidence 90 --exclude '*/tests/*' --ignore-names $(paste -sd, .vulture-ignore) .
```

Any entries listed in `.vulture-ignore` will be ignored, reducing false positives
from dynamically referenced modules such as `ml_service.app.api.routes.*` and
`ml_service.app.api.visualization.*`.
