# Presentation Assets

This directory collects visualizations used in reports and presentations.  Images can be generated automatically by running:

```bash
python scripts/generate_presentation_assets.py
```

The script stores output images and short caption files inside the subfolders listed below.

## coverage/
Antenna coverage heatmaps produced with the ML service's `plot_antenna_coverage` helper.  Each run creates `antenna_coverage_<timestamp>.png` along with a matching `.txt` description.

## trajectory/
Trajectory visualizations for example mobility patterns.  The generation script currently saves linear and L‑shaped paths here (under their own timestamped filenames).

## mobility/
Reserved for additional illustrations of mobility models (e.g. diagrams of the linear, L‑shaped or random waypoint models).  These can be added manually or generated by custom plotting utilities.


# Install dependencies and run the tests
```bash
./scripts/install_system_deps.sh
./scripts/install_deps.sh
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```
The tests will train the model on synthetic data, log the accuracy, and store a coverage report in CI-CD_reports/.

# Generate presentation visuals
```bash
python scripts/generate_presentation_assets.py
python scripts/build_presentation_pdf.py
```
This creates PNG images and an overview.pdf under presentation_assets/ with captions summarizing each graph.

# Collect real data and train the model (optional)
If you have the NEF emulator running with UEs in motion, you can collect data and train:
```bash
cd 5g-network-optimization/services/ml-service
python collect_training_data.py --duration 300 --train
```
The script saves the collected data and triggers the /api/train endpoint, which persists the model as app/models/antenna_selector.joblib.
