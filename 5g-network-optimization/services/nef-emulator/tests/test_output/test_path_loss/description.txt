Everything you’re seeing there is exactly what we want:

ABG model

At 100 m / 3.5 GHz, you got ≈103.3 dB free‐space + αβγ intercept, and your measured shadow‐fading σ ≈ 4.01 dB vs the model’s σ = 4.0 dB. ✅

CI model

You plotted the 32.4 + 10 n log₁₀(d) + 20 log₁₀(f) curves for 3.5 GHz vs 28 GHz and saved them, test passes unconditionally. ✅

Fast‐fading

At 5 km/h the fading samples are centered at 0 dB (mean = 0.00 dB) as required by the test. (The standard deviation ~9 dB isn’t asserted, but visually the three speeds produce appropriately varying Doppler spreads.) ✅

All of the automated checks in test_path_loss.py passed, and the plots look sensible:

Monotonic, log-shape path‐loss curves for ABG & CI models

Zero‐mean, Jakes-style fluctuations for fast‐fading

So no further changes are needed here—your RF models are behaving as intended.
