# Understanding the NEF Emulator Structure

Looking at the `nef_structure.txt` file reveals a comprehensive FastAPI-based backend with a well-organized structure. Let me break down the key components that are relevant to our integration:

## Key Components & Integration Points

1. **UE Movement System**
   * `backend/app/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/ue_movement.py` - This is a critical integration point for our mobility models
   * `backend/app/app/models/UE.py` - Contains the data model for UEs
   * `backend/app/app/schemas/UE.py` - Defines the API schemas for UE data
2. **Network Models**
   * `backend/app/app/models/Cell.py` and `gNB.py` - These define the network elements
   * `backend/app/app/tools/5g_nr_radio.py` - Contains radio models we'll need to enhance with our RF calculations
3. **Monitoring Events**
   * `backend/app/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/monitoringevent.py` - Handles network events that we'll extend for ML integration
   * `backend/app/app/tools/monitoring_callbacks.py` - Likely implements callback mechanisms for events
4. **QoS Management**
   * `backend/app/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/qosInformation.py` and `qosMonitoring.py` - We'll need to integrate with these for QoS-aware optimizations

## Integration Strategy

Based on this structure, our integration will involve these specific steps:

1. **Mobility Model Integration**
   * Connect our `mobility_models/models.py` to the existing UE movement system
   * Update `ue_movement.py` to use our enhanced 3GPP-compliant mobility models
2. **RF Model Enhancement**
   * Extend `5g_nr_radio.py` with our antenna models or integrate our new models with it
   * Connect to the Cell models for antenna information
3. **ML API Integration**
   * Add new endpoints to expose network state and training data
   * Implement callbacks for ML-driven handover decisions
4. **Monitoring and Metrics**
   * Extend the monitoring system to track ML-specific metrics
   * Add Prometheus export functionality
