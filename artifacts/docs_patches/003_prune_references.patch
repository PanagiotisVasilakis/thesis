 ## Implemented Components
 - **NEF Emulator** – FastAPI application that exposes REST endpoints to create UEs, retrieve movement state and trigger handovers.  The implementation lives in `services/nef-emulator/backend/app/`.  It bundles several mobility models and path‑loss calculations so it can simulate realistic radio conditions.  When ML support is disabled, it falls back to the pure A3 rule for deterministic behaviour.  The asynchronous design lets us schedule thousands of events per second without blocking other operations.
-- **ML Service** – Lightweight Flask API offering `/api/predict` and `/api/train` routes.  It loads or trains the `LightGBMSelector` model on demand, persists the model to disk and exposes metrics for accuracy and request latency.  Training data is gathered from the NEF emulator or from prerecorded traces.  The service relies on a LightGBM classifier and can optionally tune hyperparameters during startup by setting `LIGHTGBM_TUNE=1`【F:README.md†L50-L50】.

 - **Monitoring Stack** – Prometheus scrapes metrics from both services and Grafana dashboards visualise throughput, latency and model accuracy【F:5g-network-optimization/monitoring/README.md†L1-L21】.  Alerts can be configured to detect performance regressions during experiments, giving immediate feedback when tuning the ML model or A3 parameters.
 - **Docker & Kubernetes** – `docker-compose.yml` spins up the NEF emulator, ML service and monitoring stack for local development.  Kubernetes manifests under `deployment/` replicate the same setup in a cluster for scale testing and CI pipelines【F:README.md†L31-L37】.  Images are built with multi-stage Dockerfiles so the runtime environment stays slim and consistent across setups.
 
@@ -17,7 +17,7 @@ The 5G Network Optimization project demonstrates how advanced handover algorithm
 `A3EventRule` accumulates measurements of the reference signal received power (RSRP) for the serving and neighbouring cells.  The rule checks whether the target cell’s RSRP exceeds the serving cell by `A3_HYSTERESIS_DB`.  If so, a timer is started and the condition must hold for `A3_TTT_S` seconds.  Any violation resets the timer.  Once both thresholds are met the event is raised and a handover is initiated【F:5g-network-optimization/services/nef-emulator/backend/app/app/handover/a3_rule.py†L1-L23】.
 
 ## ML-Based Logic
-The `LightGBMSelector` class extends `AntennaSelector` and uses a LightGBM classifier to learn from location, movement and signal metrics for each UE.  Features include latitude, longitude, speed, normalised direction as well as derived mobility metrics like heading change rate and path curvature.  Signal quality variance (`rsrp_stddev`, `sinr_stddev`) and the UE altitude are also persisted in Feast along with the current antenna’s RSRP, SINR and optionally RSRQ readings for neighbouring cells.  Training is performed with optional validation and early stopping as shown in the implementation【F:5g-network-optimization/services/ml-service/ml_service/app/models/lightgbm_selector.py†L45-L116】.  The resulting model is exported with `joblib` and reloaded at startup.  Predictions are served in real time through the Flask API and can be logged to assess feature importance and accuracy.  The training workflow relies on `collect_training_data.py` to query the NEF emulator and save samples which are then uploaded via `/api/train`.  This approach keeps the ML implementation decoupled from the emulator while allowing incremental retraining.

 For tests that interact with the Network Exposure Function emulator, a shared `mock_nef_client` fixture is available in `services/ml-service/tests/conftest.py`.  The fixture returns a preconfigured `MagicMock` with a successful `get_status` (200) and sensible defaults for common methods like `login`, `get_headers`, `get_ue_movement_state` and `get_feature_vector`.  Individual tests can further tailor the mock as needed, keeping NEF-related tests concise and consistent.
